<details><summary>How do I connect PM2 Runtime to PM2 Enterprise on-premise?</summary>
 <p>
 When you first register, you should have a bucket created automatically, then you will have connection data in the middle in this format : 

```
> KEYMETRICS_NODE=<your KM_SITE_URL> pm2 link <identifier_one> <identifier_two>
```

You have two way to link your pm2 : 
  - Connect to the instance where pm2 is and run the command.
  - If you have container, just add these environements variables :
    - `KEYMETRICS_PUBLIC`: replace with `identifier_two>`
    - `KEYMETRICS_SECRET`: replace with `<identifier_one>`
    - `KEYMETRICS_NODE`: replace with `<your KM_SITE_URL>`
    - `INSTANCE_NAME`: (optional) replace it if you want your server in keymetrics to have a fixed name
  </p>
