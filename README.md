If you deployed with terraform (and we encourage you to so), you should be able to use `terraform apply`, it will automaticly get the latest AMI and if needed, update the running instance.
###### Docker
If you deployed with Docker, you will just need to restart with the `docker-compose.yml` file and it will automacitly pull the newest image from the docker hub
###### Other
If you want some advises on how to update if you deployed it yourself as you wanted, you can ask us at tech@keymetrics.io or on slack
