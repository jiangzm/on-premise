## Updating

###### AWS

If you deployed with terraform (and we encourage you to so), you should be able to use `terraform apply`, it will automaticly get the latest AMI and if needed, update the running instance.

###### Docker

If you deployed with Docker, you will just need to:

```bash
$ docker-compose pull km-api km-front
$ docker-compose restart km-api km-front
```

###### Other

If you want some advises on how to update if you deployed it yourself as you wanted, you can ask us at tech@keymetrics.io or on slack
